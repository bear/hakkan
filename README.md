# 発刊 hakkan
to publish

Walk the structure and files created by kaku and generate HTML pages using any templates needed.

Because kaku does not know where the files will be consumed, it doesn't need to be aware of any requirements for web servers or html even. It should generate files that can be displayed in context.

Hakkan will be how they are combined to be visible in, let's say, an editor or a browser or whatever.

this is currently an arbitrary distinction as I currently will only be publishing to a web server, but I want to see how far I can take this idea.
